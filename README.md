# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### NAME HERE

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: The model give bad perfomance, They need to do some EDA or feature engineering.

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
TODO: HPO the model with hyperparameter tuning.

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: Extract Datetime into mo, day, year and hour.

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: about 2 times better than original model. I believe it make more information to the dataset that give high perfomance to the model.

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: score decrease from 0.68 to 0.54.

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: more visualization to find insight. try more feature engineering, may be it give more perfomance.

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.

TODO: Replace the image below with your own.

## Summary
After did EDA and Feature Engineering the model give high perfomance that the original model and after did Hyperparameter Tuning they give highest perfomance than other models.
